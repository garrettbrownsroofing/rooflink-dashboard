## ‚úÖ Completed

### Monroe Dashboard with 9 Metrics
1. **Contracts Signed** - Jobs approved

### Features
- Date range selector (week/month/year/custom)
- Color-coded metric cards
- Live data only (no mock data)
- MCP server integration
- Comprehensive debugging

## üîß Current Issue

**Problem**: "No relevant data found in any of the available endpoints"

**Solution**: Enhanced debugging added - check browser console (F12) for:
- Available endpoints list
- Raw data from each endpoint
- Data processing steps
- Final dashboard data

## üìÅ Key Files

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard page
- `src/components/MonroeRevenueDashboard.tsx` - Monroe dashboard component
- `src/lib/mcp-client.ts` - MCP client

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Check browser console** when testing dashboard
2. **Analyze logs** to understand RoofLink data structure
3. **Adjust data processing** based on actual API responses
4. **Fine-tune Monroe filtering** once data structure is known

## üîç Technical Details

- MCP Server: `https://developers.rooflink.com/mcp`
- Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0
- Status: Connected and working
- Deployment: GitHub ‚Üí Vercel auto-deploy

## üí° Key Points

- Dashboard is fully built and deployed
- All 9 metrics implemented with proper UI
- Data processing needs fine-tuning based on actual API structure
- Console logging will reveal the data format
- No mock data - live RoofLink data only
